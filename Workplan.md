# Workplan

---

We to have select one of the available SMHI datasets and write a program that extracts information from the Swedish climate data.

---


- Use ROOT to make plots and eventual statistical analysis: a small code skeleton

- Section 3 contains a few examples of what kind of information you could get from the data. Decide on at least three interesting results to produce.
  - Jasmain - 3.3 example "The warmest and coldest day of each year" here we want to analyse the evolution of the hottest temperature of each year.
  - Estelle - 3.4 example "The mean temperature of each year"
  - Philip - Personal examples:  "Temperature distribution for each day during winter for each year", "Mean temperature distribution during winter for each year", "Temperature distribution for Christmas Eve every year"

- At least one of them should be our own idea and should not come from Section 3

- To “clean” the input dataset we will use any of the tools we’ve learnt during the course (ROOT, C++, bash commands, bash scripts) or anything else, as long as we document the way we did and we do not modify the original data, the cleaning process is described and the cleaned up dataset must be a separate file or set of files.
